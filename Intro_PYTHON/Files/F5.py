# Reading from a file whereby we read information that was saved in the files
# i.e reading a guest list or even shopping list
# we use open function to read from a file
# myFile = open(fileName, accessMode)
# accessMode is like READ = "r" or accessMode = "r"
# we can use accessMode with "r+" indicating read and write
# we can also append the existing files using accessMode as APPEND = "a"
# then we use read method to read the files contents
# fileContent = myFile.read()
# when reading line by line or row by row
# we use fileContent = myFile.readline() returning content of a single line
